<b>Introduction:</b>\
Following along with Chapter 7 of "Introduction to Statistical Learning First Edition" from www.statlearning.com.

<b>Exercise #3:</b>\
Suppose we fit a curve with basis functions b1(X) = X, b2(X) = (X − 1)2I(X ≥ 1). (Note that I(X ≥ 1) equals 1 for X ≥ 1 and 0 otherwise.) We fit the linear regression model
$$\large Y =β_{0} +β_{1}b_{1}(X)+β_{2}b_{2}(X)+ε $$
and obtain coefficient estimates $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ = 1, $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ = 1, $\hat{\beta}_{2}$ = −2. Sketch the estimated curve between X = −2 and X = 2. Note the intercepts, slopes, and other relevant information.

```{r}
library(GGally)

x = -2:2
y = 1 + x + -2 * (x - 1)^2 * (x >= 1)

df = data.frame(x = x, y = y)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "x", y = "y")
```
\
<center><i>By graphing the curve, I find that the curve is linear from x = -2:1., $y = 1 + x$. And the curve is quadratic from x = 1:2, $y = 1 + x - 2(x-1)^2$</i></center>\
